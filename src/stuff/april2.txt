Blackbay Asylum
Director Brian Flinch
April 2nd 1976

After the search of patient 3-3-6's room, I found my master key was missing.
After questioning the subject, he denied taking it.
He was taken to the basement until he would tell us where he put it.
After failing to tell us, we resorted to progression in Project 7D.
