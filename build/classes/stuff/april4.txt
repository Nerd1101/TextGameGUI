Blackbay Asylum
Dr. Sander Cohen
April 4th 1976

After patient 3-3-6 was brought to the basement, he kept screaming for the teddy bear the director took from him.
Project 7D is coming along nicely.
Subject was injected with 10 cc's of Catalyde and 5 cc's of Polytomol.
Soon, the subject was showing signs of telekinetic response. 
The lights flickered, room shook, tools fell off the table.
Shortly after, subject fell asleep.
Next session will have increased dosage.
