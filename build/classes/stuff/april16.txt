Blackbay Asylum
Dr. Sander Cohen
April 16th 1976

The director has informed us that the CBA is on their way.
We have to move now, this is out last chance to get out of it.
Patient 3-3-6 was woken up at 5am shortly after the final notice from the CBA.
We injected the patient with 30 cc's of Catalyde alone.
We are now awaiting results.
